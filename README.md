## Description
Do you know Riverdale? It's one of my favourite series on Netflix. In Riverdale, there's a restaurant called Pop's Chock' Lit Shoppe. Pop's has its own style: it's very retro and it gots some nice neon lights. I make a interactive menu for Pop's by using pure CSS and HTML.


## What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used for the seperation and presentation of of a html page. For example, the layout, the fonts and the styling of a page. But it is more than styling. It can also add interaction, like animation, transitions or a hover. 

## Learning Goals / Features
This are the main things I've applied (and learned) in the past few weeks:
* I made some pure animations which are only styled and animationed with CSS. See wiki > page: "A pure CSS animation"
* I used CSS enitities for fun. These are CSS codes which convert numbers, letters or even some white space (and who knows maybe more :)).
* I used z-index to play with the layers of elements. If the index of a element is higher, than it becomes on the foreground.
* I didn't use any classes. Instead, I used child & sibling selectors, `:nth-child` (which selects the child of his parent) and  a simple CSS selector where you just use `[select-this]` in css and `<div select-this></div>` in HTML.
* I changed the cursor of the user. I made an kind of neon cursor (which becomes green at a hover). This must be a PNG file.
* I changed the scrollbar and made it red by using `::-webkit-scrollbar`.
* I made soms SVG's in illustrator and found out that you can export this as a code. This can be a extremely long code. If you change the vector (for example by making less paths or circles) the code can be shorter.
* All the SVG's haven't unique ID's or classes. The consequence about this is that styles are completely ruined :(. Solution: delete the `<style>` elements and apply CSS for the style. See my wiki > page: "Using CSS on a SVG" to read more about this.
* I made my application responsive without any media queries. I used flexbox (`display:flex`) to fix this.
* I learned what progressive enhancement is (see the next paragraph :))


## Used data
I didn't know what the menu of Pop's was, so I decided to search it. I only used a part of it. In the source you'll see the link to the website I used.

## Reflection

## Credits
I would like to thank the teachers, the extra "help students", the visitors and my fellow students for helping me to accomplish my learning goals.
