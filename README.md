## Description
Do you know Riverdale? It's one of my favourite series on Netflix. In Riverdale, there's a restaurant called Pop's Chock' Lit Shoppe. Pop's has its own style: it's very retro and it gots some nice neon lights. I make a interactive menu for Pop's by using pure CSS and HTML.


## What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used for the seperation and presentation of of a html page. For example, the layout, the fonts and the styling of a page. But it is more than styling. It can also add interaction, like animation, transitions or a hover.
